## ⚙️ Core Architecture

Novera-A1 operates through a modular **six-part architecture**, each designed to maximize a specific aspect of intelligence and interaction:

### 1. 🧠 Decision Core  
Mimics human-like reasoning to interpret input, evaluate goals, and respond with a natural tone and pacing.

### 2. 🗂️ Task Orchestrator  
Handles efficient execution of micro-tasks using asynchronous processing. Ensures optimal speed and scalability across all functions.

### 3. 📚 Knowledge Vault  
Combines preloaded data, real-time knowledge retrieval, and fast-access caching. Can draw from APIs or internal embeddings.

### 4. 🧩 Context Engine  
Maintains dialogue flow, tracks emotional context, and adapts the assistant's tone and phrasing for a lifelike presence.

### 5. ⚡ Action Layer  
Delivers final responses through text, voice, or control logic. Built for low-latency output across multimodal interfaces.

### 6. 🔁 Feedback Loop  
Learns and evolves from usage patterns and errors. Continuously optimizes decision paths and response quality over time.
