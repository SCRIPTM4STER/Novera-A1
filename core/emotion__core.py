## 📝 Note from Riyad (a.k.a. JavaScriptJesus)

Hey fellow devs 👋,

So here’s the deal: I **really want** this `EMOTION__CORE` to exist. Like… badly.  
But do I want to build the whole thing myself?  
**Absolutely not 😭😭.**

If you're reading this and you’ve got ideas, skills, or just the emotional bandwidth (pun intended) to help bring Sophia’s emotional brain to life, I’m all in. I’ll contribute where I can—concepts, dialogue design, feedback loops—but I’d love for this to be a team effort.

This note is basically me yelling *“I’m here!”* from the shadows of the repo.  
You got this. I believe in you.  
Let’s give her feelings. Weird, synthetic, beautiful feelings.

—Riyad (JavaScriptJesus) 🧠💙
